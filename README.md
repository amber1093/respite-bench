# Respite Bench

![Title](title.png)

## Description

Inspired by games such as Dark Souls and Hollow Knight, this mod adds a few items to replicate common mechanics found in souls-like games, namely respawnable enemies and having rest points (bonfires, benches, etc.). Designed with map making in mind.

## Content

Respite Bench currently consists of a bench, flask and the Mob Respawner.

### Flasks

Flasks are re-usable health potions. Can be refilled at a bench. Flasks can be crafted by combining 3 flask shards.

### Bench

Acts as a rest point. Refills all empty flasks, removes all potion effects and fully heals the player.
Using a bench will cause all Mob Respawners to be able to spawn mobs once again.

### Mob Respawner

Can spawn mobs, similar to the spawner. Works with custom spawn eggs. Instead of spawning mobs endlessly, it will keep track of the mobs it spawns and will not respawn them (until a bench is used).
